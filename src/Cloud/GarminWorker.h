// DES-001 — GarminWorker: dedicated worker thread owner of the SSO call
// path. Auth-only slice for REQ-002 end-to-end; later slices (REQ-003 MFA,
// REQ-006 RefreshTokens, REQ-007/010 Activity ops, REQ-012 Disconnect,
// REQ-014 FetchProfile) extend this class additively with the corresponding
// slots + signals against the same IGarminPyAdapter interface.
//
// Threading: the worker is intended to be moveToThread()'d onto a dedicated
// QThread by its owner (WorkerAuthClient sets up the connection chain via
// Qt::AutoConnection so calls cross the thread boundary as queued
// invocations). The worker DOES NOT own its QThread — the owner does.
