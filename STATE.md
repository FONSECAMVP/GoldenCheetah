TEAM: on (5 agents: scout, builder, adversary, validator, librarian)
RIGOR: FULL (Phase 0 backfill 2026-07-11; project ran A0–A5 + STRIDE + per-slice CLV = FULL de facto)

PHASE: Phase 2.2 — Garmin Connect integration. Per-REQ/DES/TEST/VAL status → traceability.md.

CURRENT: **REQ-008 DONE + COMMITTED `ff9cce966`** (feat(garmin), 2026-07-20, 40 files, path-scoped Garmin only) —
incremental sync + dedup, LIVE end-to-end (A+B+C + Slice-D producer + DEC-019 trigger). garmin 18/18, pytest 25/25,
app links. Pre-commit reformatted 9 files → re-verified per LSN-007 before the clean commit. A3-R008 fully
dispositioned (F1 accepted+ticketed REQ-016; F3/F4 fixed; F2/F5 tracked). **Only remaining step: the docs-record
commit** of the governance ledgers (STATE/WIKI/lessons/.claude/workflow-garminconnect/*), mirroring REQ-007's
f637c138b — the user approved it. Unrelated pre-session Coach/Gui/CMake/vcpkg/skill edits remain uncommitted
(NOT Garmin, left for their owners; verified absent from ff9cce966). The DEC-019 trigger slice closed the last blocker:
`CloudService::persistConnectSuccess`/`disconnect()` default-no-op virtuals; `GarminConnect` overrides both; one
`AddCloudWizard` capture drives persist on both pages' id-gated `succeeded(GarminAuthSuccess)` (direct + post-MFA);
`deleteClicked()` calls generic `disconnect()`. TEST-051 (both paths + stale-reply-no-overwrite, A3-R003-06
preserved) + TEST-052 (disconnect clears tokens/preserves sidecars + base no-op). **A3-R008-01 FIXED** (producer now
called → real uid resolves end-to-end), **D-R008-01 FIXED** (real disconnect() virtual + DES-002 prose corrected).
Also incidentally closes the REQ-004/006 C++ token-save wiring (GarminTokenStore::save now called in
production). Ratified during build: a 2nd base virtual `persistConnectSuccess` (symmetric to disconnect, both
no-ops) so the wizard dispatches through `CloudService*` without a Garmin cast (DEC-019 cascade note).
Prior focus (superseded): Slice D producer done, trigger-gated. Slice D (DEC-018 B) built the producer — `GarminAuthSuccess.tokenBlob`
carry-forward, `GarminTokenStore::persistConnectSuccess`(ordered tokens.json→active-account.json write)/`saveActiveAccount`/
`loadActiveAccountUserId`/`clearAccount`, `resolveGarminUserId` REPOINTED to active-account.json; TEST-049 (producer
unit) + TEST-050 (end-to-end, NO ctor override — the LSN-024 proof). **But the builder correctly FIRED the
stop-and-report hatch: the producer has NO production caller** — `persistConnectSuccess`/`clearAccount` are never
invoked on a real connect/disconnect, so A3-R008-01 is only PARTIALLY closed (producer green, trigger unwired). Three
constraints block a mechanical trigger (→ DEC-019): (i) the wizard deliberately defers config-dir routing
(AddCloudWizard.cpp:180-185); (ii) the MFA success path bypasses `GarminCredentialsPage::onAuthFinished` (early-returns
on MfaRequired≠InFlight), so ONE trigger must catch BOTH direct + post-MFA `finished(GarminAuthSuccess)`; (iii) there
is NO `removeSettings`/disconnect virtual in CloudService.h — DES-002's "removeSettings overridden to Disconnect"
surface does not exist under that name (D-R008-01, design↔code). Producer/reader/tests are green and ready to be
CALLED the moment DEC-019 picks the trigger layer.
Prior focus (still true): **A+B+C CODE-COMPLETE, A3-R008 partial.** A = listing seam (T-042/043/044), B =
dedicated `GarminSidecarStore` (DEC-017 A; T-045/046), C = `GarminConnect::readdir` sync orchestration composing
A+B onto the CloudService sync contract (T-047/048): concurrent-guard (REQ-NF-Perf-002), since=from/backfill-state/
now()-7d, off-thread list via new `IGarminDownloadClient::listActivities`, CloudServiceEntry per activity, Tier-1
short-circuit filters already-imported ids BEFORE download (DES-010 5a), readFile-success records via
GarminSidecarStore + advances backfill-state. **Verification Gate PASS on all three** — orchestrator independently
confirmed pytest 25/25 + garmin ctest 17/17 executables (REQ-007 readFile intact, +testGarminConnectSync/
testGarminSidecarStore), FILES vs git status, LSN-018 both-lists, short-circuit-in-readdir on disk, app links clean.
**A3-R008 attack surface (catalogued from builder NOTES):**
(1) **BLOCKING-for-end-to-end cross-slice gap** — `GarminConnect::resolveGarminUserId()` reads `garmin_user_id`
from tokens.json but NO connect-flow code writes it yet → production readdir resolves EMPTY uid + no-ops; needs a
REQ-002/004 connect-flow persistence slice (tests use the ctor uid-override to stay deterministic).
(2) since-format: readdir emits `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"` UTC, untested against the real Python `list_activities_since`
(OQ1-adjacent; ISO-8601 fallback exists on parse but not on emit).
(3) record-ordering: sidecar records "staged" not "imported into RideCache" (optimistic Tier-1; RideCache Tier-2 is
the safety net per DES-010) — a downstream parse-reject would still skip next sync.
(4) Slice-B residuals still live: `recordImported` RMW silently rewrites torn/owner-wider map; malformed entries
skipped as Ok-with-gaps; `<uid>` raw in filename (no sanitization); Windows-ACL TODO stub (A3-R004-09 posture).
(5) `m_pendingStartTimes` never pruned (bounded, harmless); `to` param ignored (incremental-only, by design);
capabilities() still `Query|Download` (no Sync bit in the CloudService enum).
(6) Slice-A residuals: OQ1 listing-API signature pin; summary normalization drops all keys but activityId/
startTimeGMT; non-dict-item branch surviving-mutant candidate (no `list_bad_item` pystub scenario).
**Slice A** mirrors the REQ-007 download seam: `garmin_client.list_activities_since(ts_gmt)` (calls
`get_activities_by_date` — OQ1-pinned by fake, real signature unconfirmed) → new `PyListOutcome`/`GarminActivitySummary{activityId,startTimeGMT}`
+ pure-virtual `IGarminPyAdapter::listActivitiesSince` → `PyEmbeddedAdapter` marshalling (iterator protocol,
classifyListException) → `GarminWorker` ListActivities op emitting `activitiesListed(QUuid,summaries)` /
`listFailed(QUuid,GarminListFailure)`. T-042/043/044. Every test Fake/stub gained a conforming
`listActivitiesSince` override (seam-conformance, 5 test files). **Verification Gate PASS** — orchestrator
independently re-ran pytest 25/25 + garmin ctest 15/15 executables, diffed FILES vs `git status` (13 M + 1 ??,
all Garmin-scoped, no governance writes), confirmed `PyEmbeddedAdapter` is the sole production implementer + app
links clean, and audited T-044 (sinceGmt+summaries verbatim + worker-thread) / T-042 (LSN-006 type-classify,
empty-is-success) as faithful criterion encodings. **A3-R008 not yet run** (deferred to cover Slices A+B together,
per the REQ-003 A+B→A3 pattern). Slice A residuals for A3: OQ1 listing-API signature pin; summary normalization
drops all keys but activityId/startTimeGMT (may need widening for RideCache dedup in C); non-dict-item branch has
a surviving-mutant candidate (no `list_bad_item` pystub scenario yet).

Prior: **REQ-003 (MFA) CODE-COMPLETE — both slices built, WORKING TREE, UNCOMMITTED (user has not asked to
commit).** Slice A (seam) + Slice B (UI) done, each Verification-Gate-PASSED and merged. **Slice A:** two-step MFA
seam — `garmin_client.py` `login()` retains pending state + returns `{"mfa_required":True}`, `submit_mfa(code)`
resumes the retained session → identity dict (bad→kind='auth' by TYPE/LSN-006, no-pending→'unknown');
`IGarminPyAdapter::MfaRequired`+`submitMfa()`;
`GarminWorker` `submitMfa` slot + `mfaRequired(QUuid)`; `IGarminAuthClient` `mfaRequired`+`submitMfa`;
`WorkerAuthClient` forward+re-emit; `PyEmbeddedAdapter`. MFA routes via a dedicated `mfaRequired(QUuid)` signal, NOT
a GarminAuthFailure kind (D-R003-01). T-027..031. **Slice B:** `GarminMfaPage` (new, page 22 — 6-digit InputMask,
`hasSixDigits` gate, 3-attempt→`aborted()` non-retry); `GarminCredentialsPage` gained `MfaRequired` state +
`mfaPending()`+`onMfaRequired`; `AddCloudWizard` routes 21→22 on mfaRequired, MFA `aborted()`→`reject()`. T-032..035.
**LSN-018 satisfied** — GarminMfaPage.cpp in both test + main-app source lists; GoldenCheetah links clean (binary
carries 34 GarminMfaPage symbols, orchestrator-verified). **Verification Gate PASS on both slices** — orchestrator
independently re-ran pytest 19/19 + garmin-fast ctest 14/14, diffed FILES vs `git status`, confirmed symbols on
disk, verified the app-link, and audited the tests as faithful criterion encodings (mfaRequired-exactly-once,
no-MFA regression, bad-OTP→Auth, 6-digit gate, 3-strikes-abort, page-22 routing killing 4 mutants).
**Hardening slice (A3-R003 findings) DONE + Gate-PASSED:** T-036 real embedded-Python MFA bridge coverage
(closed BLOCKING A3-R003-01), T-037 WAC MFA wiring, T-038 MFA retention, T-039 initializePage reentry reset
(closed back-nav leak A3-R003-05), T-040 real stale-failure assertion (KILLED mutant M1, closed A3-R003-07),
T-041 terminal-state dup-delivery guard (closed A3-R003-06); T-035 hardened (B-R003-03). Coverage tests passed
first run — no latent bug found. Orchestrator re-verified garmin ctest 15/15 + garmin-py 23/23 + pytest 20/20 +
app-link + M1-kill. **REQ-003 DONE + COMMITTED `8cbc4722d`** (feat(garmin), 2026-07-19, 28 files, path-scoped to
Garmin only; final CLV VAL-015 PASS; pre-commit clang-format/ruff/mypy passed after 2 unused type:ignore removed
+ 2 files reformatted, re-verified per LSN-007). Prior: **REQ-007 DONE + COMMITTED `d312886a6`** (docs-record
`f637c138b`).

NEXT_GATE: **USER CHOSE: build REQ-008 Slice D (uid-producer wiring) to close A3-R008-01 before commit.** BLOCKED on
subagent spawn until ~9:20pm Australia/Hobart (account-wide session-usage limit — the adversary died on it; builders
can't spawn either). Orchestrator briefing-prep DONE: the auth-success hook point is `GarminWorker::emitAuthOutcome`
Success arm (GarminWorker.cpp:58) → `finished(GarminAuthSuccess{garmin_user_id,display_name})` (IGarminAuthClient.h:29,
NOTE: GarminAuthSuccess does NOT currently carry the token blob) → `GarminCredentialsPage::onAuthFinished`
(GarminCredentialsPage.cpp:95, persists NOTHING today). `PyAuthOutcome` carries a tokenBlob (REQ-004 TEST-013); the
blob comes from `dump_tokens()` = raw garth `dumps()` (NO garmin_user_id key).

**Plan (in order):**
0. **DEC-018 DONE** (Option B, active-account.json) + **Slice D producer DONE** (green, trigger-gated) — see CURRENT.
1. **DEC-019 DONE (Option C)** — scout-researched (all citations orchestrator-verified), user chose C:
   `CloudService::disconnect()` default-no-op virtual + GarminConnect owns persist/disconnect; a single wizard-level
   `finished()` capture drives persist on both auth paths. Key reframe: REQ-012's delete-on-disconnect has NO sibling
   precedent (deleteClicked/AthletePages.cpp:143-161 only flips active flags; siblings keep tokens in QSettings
   forever) → Garmin is stricter, so a testable GarminConnect::disconnect() seam beats a magic-string GUI branch.
2. **DEC-019 trigger wiring slice DONE + Gate-PASSED + merged (2026-07-20).** TEST-051/052; stale-reply impl = (b)
   per-page id-gated `succeeded` signal; A3-R008-01 + D-R008-01 FIXED; DES-002 prose corrected; the persistConnectSuccess
   2nd-virtual ratified. garmin 18/18, app links.
3. **A3-R008 full pass DONE (2026-07-20) — VERDICT FINDINGS, 1 BLOCKING (F1).** See BLOCKING/LAST_CYCLE.
4. **NEXT GATE — USER DISPOSITION ON F1 (blocking).** Fix-now (reconcile pass or record-after-confirm — a small
   hardening slice) vs accept-with-rationale + ticket for v1. Recommend bundling the cheap non-blockers into the same
   slice IF fixing: F3 (add list_bad_item pystub coverage), F4 (rename disconnect()→disconnectService() to kill the
   QObject name-hiding footgun), F2 (sidecar RMW salvage). F5 stays an OQ1 accept-note (spike vs the real wheel).
5. **Then the REQ-008 feature commit** (path-scoped to the Garmin set — now also includes src/Gui/AthletePages.cpp +
   src/Cloud/CloudService.h + the wizard/page/GarminConnect edits; NEVER `git add -A`, unrelated pre-session Coach/Gui/
   CMake/vcpkg + skill edits stay out — per LSN-010/007).
--- superseded (kept for provenance): the old plan step 1 read ---
1-OLD. **DEC-garmin-018 FIRST (Three Options, present to user) — tokens.json envelope for garmin_user_id**, because
   resolveGarminUserId needs a top-level uid but tokens.json's schema is security-locked by REQ-006 (loadChecked
   perm-check) + REQ-007 (from_tokens/loadTokens parse). Candidate options: (A) WRAP tokens.json as
   `{garmin_user_id, tokens:<blob>}` — one file/one write, but from_tokens+loadTokens+loadChecked callers must read
   `.tokens` (touches the locked contract); (B) SEPARATE account-agnostic `garminconnect/active-account.json =
   {garmin_user_id}` — leaves tokens.json a pure OAuth blob (REQ-006/007 untouched), resolveGarminUserId reads the
   new file; adds one more perm/atomic-write file; (C) PARSE the uid out of the existing garth blob — no new write
   but fragile/OQ-risk on garth internals. Recommendation leans B (least disturbance to the security-locked file).
2. **qgdw-builder Slice D**: wire the chosen persistence into the auth-success path (carry the blob to onAuthFinished
   OR persist in the worker/CloudService lifecycle; call GarminTokenStore::save + write the uid per DEC-018), + an
   END-TO-END test that connects with a REAL (non-override) uid round-trip → readdir resolves it (the test that
   A3-R008-01 says is missing). TEST ids garmin-T-049 (+T-050 if the envelope needs its own unit). Then Verify+merge.
3. **qgdw-adversary — FINISH A3-R008** over the now-complete A+B+C+D (avoids running A3 twice): the unrun probes —
   since-format contract, stage-vs-import record ordering, concurrent-guard wedge/teardown, non-dict-item
   surviving-mutant (add a `list_bad_item` pystub scenario if it survives), sidecar RMW-over-corrupt data-loss.
4. Verify, disposition, re-spawn builder only for any BLOCKING finding, re-run until clean. **Then the REQ-008
   feature commit** — path-scoped to the Garmin set ONLY (src/Cloud/{GarminConnect.*,GarminDownloadClient.*,
IGarminDownloadClient.h,IGarminPyAdapter.h,PyEmbeddedAdapter.*,GarminWorker.*,GarminSidecarStore.*} +
src/Python/garminconnect/garmin_client.py + src/Python/garminconnect/tests/test_adapter_list.py +
unittests/Core/garminconnect/** + the two CMake hunks), NEVER `git add -A` (the working tree still carries unrelated
pre-session Coach/Gui/CMake/vcpkg + skill-methodology edits — NOT Garmin), per LSN-007 (re-verify post pre-commit
reformat) + LSN-010 (stamp the ledger record).

Prior gate: **REQ-003 COMPLETE + COMMITTED `8cbc4722d`.** LSN-010 ledger-record stamped (traceability Commit
column + STATE/WIKI banners flipped). Remaining optional: a docs-record commit of the Garmin governance files
(STATE/WIKI/lessons + .claude/workflow-garminconnect/*) mirroring REQ-007's `f637c138b`, if the user wants the
ledger history committed too. Next feature is the user's call — candidate REQs still open per traceability:
REQ-008 (incremental sync + dedup), REQ-010 (bulk backfill), REQ-014 (error translation), REQ-015 (CAPTCHA —
shares the GarminMfaPage/GarminCredentialsPage family, would also close A3-R003-09's onMfaRequired guard). Manual
Phase-3 residuals: REQ-NF-Perf-001/003 stopwatch, OQ1 live smoke (need a real Garmin account). NOTE the working
tree still carries unrelated pre-session edits (`src/Coach/*`, `src/Gui/*`, root `CMakeLists.txt`, `vcpkg.json`,
`.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/agents/*`) — NOT Garmin; a future Garmin commit must stay path-scoped. The Garmin commit
must include ONLY: `src/Cloud/{IGarminPyAdapter.h, GarminWorker.*, IGarminAuthClient.h, WorkerAuthClient.*,
PyEmbeddedAdapter.*, GarminMfaPage.*, GarminCredentialsPage.*, AddCloudWizard.cpp}` + `src/Python/garminconnect/
garmin_client.py` + `src/Python/garminconnect/tests/test_adapter_mfa.py` + `unittests/Core/garminconnect/**`
(new MfaPage test + seam-conformance edits + pystub + the two CMake hunks) + the `src/CMakeLists.txt`
GC_WANT_GARMINCONNECT GarminMfaPage.cpp hunk (hunk-split from the unrelated Coach/root edits). NOTE the working
tree still carries unrelated pre-session edits (`src/Coach/*`, `src/Gui/*`, root `CMakeLists.txt`, `vcpkg.json`,
`.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/agents/*`) — NOT Garmin; the Garmin commit must stay path-scoped, never `git add -A`.

BLOCKING: **0 open blocking. F3 + F4 FIXED + Gate-PASSED + merged (2026-07-20)** — TEST-053 non-dict-item coverage
(mutation-proven) + `disconnect()`→`disconnectService()` rename (QObject name-hiding killed); garmin 18/18, pytest
25/25, app links. **All A3-R008 findings dispositioned — REQ-008 ready for the path-scoped commit.** **A3-R008-F1 — ACCEPTED-WITH-RATIONALE for v1, ticketed as REQ-016** (record-after-confirm/reconcile;
deferred). User chose accept+ticket (2026-07-20): read-only sync of Garmin's own generally-valid FIT; the proper fix
is non-trivial (sidecar records the transient staging name, not the final RideItem) and better scoped as REQ-016;
documented + lessoned (LSN-025), not buried. F2 folded into REQ-016. Details of the original defect:
The full A3-R008 adversary pass (2026-07-20) found it: `GarminConnect::readFile` records the Tier-1 dedup entry (imported-<uid>.json) at
GarminConnect.cpp:374/:392 BEFORE the async base import confirms a parse; on a parse-fail (CloudService.cpp:1937
ride==NULL → silent return, no file written) the activity is recorded-as-imported and PERMANENTLY, SILENTLY skipped
on every future sync — Tier-2 has nothing to catch. CONFIRMED on disk. Violates REQ-008/US-3 "sync gets everything."
Fix options: (1) reconcile pass (drop sidecar entries whose RideItem doesn't exist → re-download), (2) record-after-
confirm (new hook from base readComplete-success — touches CloudService base), (3) accept-with-rationale + ticket
(Garmin FIT usually valid; document the edge). Blocks the REQ-008 commit until dispositioned. Lesson LSN-025.
Non-blocking open from the same pass: F2 (sidecar RMW clobbers on torn precondition — cheap salvage fix, LSN-026),
F3 (PyDict_Check guard correct but ZERO coverage — add list_bad_item pystub, mutant-confirmed survivor), F4
(CloudService::disconnect() name-hides QObject::disconnect for ~15 subclasses — inert footgun, rename to
disconnectService, LSN-027). Accept-note: F5 (get_activities_by_date single-arg "since" may mismatch the real
two-arg date-range wheel API — DEC-014 OQ1, spike vs real wheel before live). Prior blockers all remain fixed:
A3-R008-01 FIXED (DEC-019 trigger wired — producer now called, live sync resolves a real uid end-to-end; TEST-051/052). D-R008-01 FIXED (CloudService::disconnect() virtual + DES-002 prose corrected). Accept-with-note
residual for the full A3-R008 pass: T-051 exercises the wizard→base-virtual→real-producer wiring through a STUB
CloudService (GarminConnect can't link into the Python-free wizard harness — same constraint as A3-R007-02); the real
GarminConnect override is covered by T-050 (persist) + T-052 (disconnect). The remaining catalogued A3-R008 probes
(since-format contract, stage-vs-import record ordering, concurrent-guard wedge, non-dict-item mutant,
RMW-over-corrupt) are STILL UNRUN — the full adversary pass is the next gate. Prior REQ-003/007 residuals all remain resolved/accepted:
A3-R003-01 FIXED (T-036 real-bridge coverage, BLOCKING CLEARED). B-R003-01/02/03 FIXED
(T-037/038/035). A3-R003-05 FIXED (T-039), A3-R003-06 FIXED (T-041), A3-R003-07 FIXED (T-040, mutant M1 killed).
accept-with-note residuals: D-R003-01 (design↔code MFA-routing note), A3-R003-08 (OQ1 sentinel guess, bounded),
A3-R003-09 (onMfaRequired terminal guard — unreachable, deferred to next page-touch). OQ1: real-garth needs-MFA
sentinel + `resume_login()` unconfirmed vs unbundled wheel (pinned by fake). Carried from REQ-007: A3-R007-02/-04
accepted residuals. Carried non-blocking: A3-R004-04/05/06 (fault-injection), -07 (concurrency, mitigated by
DES-001 single-worker), -08 (root-run test), -09 (Windows CI); TR-08 → Phase 1.5 with A2-001; TR-06 fidelity
check; TR-03 guarded by TEST-007. Detail → findings.md.

to the Garmin src/Cloud + src/Python + unittests/Core/garminconnect + the two hunk-split CMake lists ONLY.
**REQ-003 (MFA) hardening slice — WORKING TREE, UNCOMMITTED (2026-07-19):** MODIFIED source `src/Cloud/
GarminMfaPage.{h,cpp}` (initializePage reset + terminal guards + test-only attemptCount()), `src/Cloud/
GarminCredentialsPage.{h,cpp}` (initializePage reset + terminal guards); MODIFIED tests/fixtures
`unittests/Core/garminconnect/{pystubs/garmin_client.py (T-036 MFA scenario), testGarminConnectPyAdapter.cpp
(T-036), testGarminConnectAuthClient.cpp (T-037), testGarminConnectMfaPage.cpp (T-040 tautology fix + T-041/T-039),
testGarminConnectCredentialsPage.cpp (T-041/T-039), testGarminConnectWizardRouting.cpp (T-035 harden)}` +
`src/Python/garminconnect/tests/test_adapter_mfa.py` (T-038). No CMake edits (no new production .cpp; MfaPage
already wired by Slice B). garmin ctest 15/15 + garmin-py 23/23 + pytest 20/20 + GoldenCheetah link re-verified.
**ALL THREE SLICES (A+B+hardening) COMMITTED TOGETHER as `8cbc4722d`** (feat(garmin), 2026-07-19, 28 files,
path-scoped): staged the Garmin src/Cloud + src/Python/garminconnect + unittests/Core/garminconnect set + the
hunk-split `src/CMakeLists.txt` GarminMfaPage.cpp hunk ONLY (the Coach/calendar hunks of src/CMakeLists.txt
stayed unstaged via `git apply --cached` of an extracted patch). Pre-commit: clang-format reformatted
GarminMfaPage.cpp + testGarminConnectMfaPage.cpp (brace/wrap only) + 2 unused `# type: ignore` removed from
test_adapter_mfa.py (mypy --strict); re-verified garmin-fast 14/14 + pytest 20/20 post-fix per LSN-007, then
committed clean (all hooks passed). Unrelated pre-session edits (`src/Coach/*`, `src/Gui/*`, root `CMakeLists.txt`,
`vcpkg.json`, `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/agents/*`) remain UNCOMMITTED — verified none entered `8cbc4722d`.

LAST_CLV: VAL-015 — 2026-07-19 — FINAL REQ-003 commit-gate CLV over the complete feature (T-027..041 + hardening).
Content verdict PASS (9/9): findings clean/0-blocking, no false-done (every `fixed` finding's code confirmed on
disk), spine T-027..041 consistent, all 5 criterion clauses covered + strengthened (real-bridge/retention/reentry/
dup-guard), design.md honest, registries consistent. The git-less validator raised ONE FAIL it could not
corroborate — "is REQ-003 really uncommitted?" — because it reasoned from the FROZEN session-start git snapshot
(predates this session's files) with no git tools. Orchestrator resolved with live `git status --porcelain` +
`git log`: LEDGER CONFIRMED — all REQ-003 files are M/?? (GarminMfaPage.* + test_adapter_mfa.py +
testGarminConnectMfaPage.cpp untracked; seam/page/wizard files modified), HEAD is still `f637c138b` (no REQ-003
commit). Net: **PASS, clean to commit.** The false-FAIL → LSN-023 (brief git-less agents with live git state).
Prior: VAL-014 — 2026-07-18 (REQ-003 Slices A+B, PASS-WITH-WARN). Superseded verdict line below retained for
the cycle detail:
LAST_CLV_PRIOR: VAL-014 — 2026-07-18 — incremental over the whole REQ-003 (MFA) changeset (T-027..035). Verdict
PASS-WITH-WARN: spine (REQ→DEC→DES→TEST) consistent, all 5 criterion clauses have covering assertions, design
honesty confirmed (D-R003-01 enum note matches on-disk `{Auth,Network,Unknown}`), findings register 0 open-blocking,
registries consistent, LSN-018 build-graph truthful (GarminMfaPage.cpp in src/CMakeLists.txt). The 3 recorded gaps
(B-R003-01/02/03) confirmed as the ONLY gaps — no new coverage hole, 0 FAIL. Two hygiene WARNs raised + REMEDIATED
this pass by the orchestrator: design.md:219 "future GarminMfaPage" prose (now realized-note) + STATE "GREEN"
status-word for submit_mfa (reworded; verdict lives in traceability). Prior CLV runs and their verdicts →

LAST_CYCLE: A3-R008 (REQ-008 incremental sync, FULL feature A+B+C+D+trigger) — 2026-07-20 — VERDICT: FINDINGS
(complete pass, fresh adversary). 1 BLOCKING (F1 record-before-confirm — see BLOCKING) + F2/F3 non-blocking +
F4/F5 informational. REFUTED (verified non-issues): uid-producer holds end-to-end (wizard's cloudService is always a
real GarminConnect via clone(context)); stub-vs-real dispatch = test-harness-only; stale-reply guard double-gated
(id + InFlight); disconnect dir matches (same context); concurrent-guard RAII correct + tested. Live mutation
experiment on PyDict_Check (F3) — files snapshotted + md5-restored, ctest 18/18 clean after. Happy-path verdict: the
complete feature SATISFIES REQ-008/US-3 for well-formed data; F1 is the reliability gap on imperfect data. Lessons
LSN-025/026/027 captured. Prior: A3-R008 (partial, session-limit) — 2026-07-19. Superseded by this full pass.
LAST_CYCLE_PRIOR: A3-R008 (REQ-008 incremental sync, A+B+C) — 2026-07-19 — VERDICT: PARTIAL/FINDINGS (subagent adversary
terminated on a session-usage limit before reporting; orchestrator ran the highest-value hypothesis INLINE — the
commit-gating uid-resolution check). Result: **1 CONFIRMED blocking-for-end-to-end finding A3-R008-01** (uid-producer
gap — see BLOCKING). Happy-path verdict for a correctly-resolved uid: the A+B+C logic satisfies REQ-008/US-3
(Tier-1 short-circuit prevents re-download, records advance the cursor, concurrent-guard rejects) — the defect is a
missing PRODUCER, not consumer logic. The remaining catalogued probes (since-format contract, stage-vs-import record
ordering, concurrent-guard wedge/teardown, non-dict-item surviving-mutant, sidecar RMW-over-corrupt data-loss) were
NOT run — a fresh-context qgdw-adversary must complete A3-R008 after the 9:20pm Australia/Hobart reset before the
feature gate closes. Lesson captured: LSN-024 (consumer-of-deferred-contract). Prior:
A3-R003 (REQ-003 MFA, both slices) — 2026-07-18 — VERDICT: FINDINGS. Feature sound on the happy
paths (3-strikes boundary correct-by-trace, no-MFA regression intact, no OTP/password logging, wizard
idempotency structural). 8 findings + 1 surviving mutant. **1 BLOCKING: A3-R003-01** — the REAL embedded-Python
MFA bridge (PyEmbeddedAdapter dict-sentinel + submitMfa refcounting) has ZERO `garmin-py` coverage while every
sibling op has a pystub scenario. Confirmed B-R003-01/02/03 (→ A3-R003-02/03/04). NEW non-blocking: A3-R003-05
(Back-nav state leak — edited creds silently discarded), A3-R003-06 (dup-delivery terminal-state undefended).
Informational: A3-R003-07 (TEST-034 tautology `||true` → why mutant **M1** [drop stale-id guard in
GarminMfaPage::onAuthFailed] survives), A3-R003-08 (OQ1 sentinel guess, bounded blast radius, accepted).
Verification Gate on the report: PASS (orchestrator spot-checked F1 pystub/PyAdapter emptiness + the line-221
tautology — both accurate). Lessons captured: LSN-020 (real-bridge-behind-fake), LSN-021 (wizard-page reentry
reset), LSN-022 (tautological assertion). Prior: A3-R007 (REQ-007) — 2026-07-18. Cycle narratives → cycles/.
